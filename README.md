Simple Angular App for testing basic knowledge of Angular

The skeleton comes with index.html, controller.js, factory.js and style.css

Stage 1- index.html is a Contact List, it has Name and Phone number as labels add the text box to enter values, it has two buttons Add and Get All. For this stage make Add button fuctional, any value entered in Name and Phone field should get added in a list and displayed under Result section in a table with Name and Phone as seperate columns. Use only controller.js to achieve the same.

Stage 2 - Make "Get All" button functional, call https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API and display the name and phone in the table which is returned in response of the API.
